# PongEvolve - Your Clever Pong Adversary

The AI Pong agent that just keeps getting better and better at beating *you*.

## Concept description

This project is created by [Oskar Linke](github.com/OskarLinke) and [Julian Barragan](github.com/JulianBarraganG) and is intended to be a proof of concept, 
for a dynamic AI adversary experience.

The idea is to take a simple yet engaging game domain, such as Pong, available on an [accessible platform]() (upcoming webapp), 
and find yourself face to face with a non-human adversary, which is learning from playing against you and getting better day by day.

## Goals

The project is under development, and is developed in the name of scientific curiousity and learning.
Being that we primarily have experience with academic programming, it also presents a great learning opportunity to learn about; 
- Full-stack development practices
- In particular front-end development and popular tools therin e.g. TypeScript and Next.js
- Deploying in the cloud with containerization such as Docker
- The challenges of creating a sample-efficient reinforcement learning autonomous Pong agent

Within the [continual learning](https://wiki.continualai.org/the-continualai-wiki/introduction-to-continual-learning), 
what are the state-of-the-art methods, techniques, and algorithms to make the best possible Pong adversary?
Exploring exactly this question, is the main source of motivation for this project.

## When can I face this worthy robot adversary?

We are developing this in our spare time alongside work and university, but we expect the earliest version to be release by the end of Summer 2026.
